5.  Name your project and package.
6.  From the options select React.
7.  Now depending on your need select Typescript or Javascript.
8.  Now to install the node modules, run the command: npm install
9.  Then change the directory to go inside your project directory. For that run the command: cd "your_project_name"
10. To install the node modules, run the command: npm install.
11. Now you application is created. The src folder conatins the code of your application in the App.css, App.jsx or App.tsx, index.css and main.jsx or main.tsx files.
12. Add 2 more files store.js and your_application_nameSlice.js. Write their code.
    
    App.css: Contains styles specific to the App component. Used to style the overall layout and appearance.

    App.jsx / App.tsx: The main component that defines the overall structure and renders child components. Uses .jsx for JavaScript or .tsx for TypeScript.
    
    index.css: Contains global styles and resets for the entire application. It is applied to the app before rendering.
    
    main.jsx / main.tsx: The entry point where the app is rendered into the DOM. It connects the React app to the root HTML element.
    
    store.js: Configures the Redux store, combining reducers and middleware. This is where the appâ€™s global state is managed.
    
    your_application_nameSlice.js: Defines a Redux slice with state, actions, and reducers for a specific feature or domain of the app. This is part of the Redux Toolkit for managing state.

13. Your can change/modify the files according to your need.
14. Then to run the application, run the command: npm run dev
15. A local host link will appear Ctrl + Click that link to open the application on the browser.

7. Open Environment variables from search.
8. Under system vaiables click on Path then Edit.
9. Verify that the path to where your git is installed is present there.
10. If not add the path.

Step # 04: Push your aplication to Github

1. Goto: https://github.com/
2. Login/SignUp
3. Create a new repository. (Do not initialize it with README.MD or .gitignore beacuse your project already contains those files)
4. Open terminal and navigate to the directory in which your project is present using: cd "path_to_your_project_directory" or simply just open the folder from file explorer Right Click and open terminal.
  # Step 1: Initialize Git repository  
  git init  
  
   Step 2: Add a remote repository (Replace <repository_url> with your actual GitHub repo URL)  
  git remote add origin <repository_url>  
  
   Step 3: Stage all files  
  git add .  
  
   Step 4: Commit the changes with a message  
  git commit -m "Initial commit"  
  
   Step 5: Push changes to the GitHub repository (on the main branch)  
  git branch -M main  
  git push -u origin main  

Step # 05: Deploy to Vercel
1. Goto: https://vercel.com/
